frequency: 50

# The period, in seconds, after which we consider a sensor to have timed out. In this event, we carry out a predict
# cycle on the EKF without correcting it. This parameter can be thought of as the minimum frequency with which the
# filter will generate new output. Defaults to 1 / frequency if not specified.
sensor_timeout: 0.1

# ekf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node both use a 3D omnidirectional motion model. If this parameter is
# set to true, no 3D information will be used in your state estimate. Use this if you are operating in a planar
# environment and want to ignore the effect of small variations in the ground plane that might otherwise be detected
# by, for example, an IMU. Defaults to false if unspecified.
two_d_mode: true

# Use this parameter to provide an offset to the transform generated by ekf_localization_node. This can be used for
# future dating the transform, which is required for interaction with some other packages. Defaults to 0.0 if
# unspecified.
transform_time_offset: 0.0

# Use this parameter to provide specify how long the tf listener should wait for a transform to become available.
# Defaults to 0.0 if unspecified.

# unhappy with any settings or data.

# Debug settings. Not for the faint of heart. Outputs a ludicrous amount of information to the file specified by

# [ADVANCED]  The EKF and UKF models follow a standard predict/correct cycle. During prediction, if there is no
# acceleration reference, the velocity at time t+1 is simply predicted to be the same as the velocity at time t. During
# correction, this predicted value is fused with the measured value to produce the new velocity estimate. This can be
# problematic, as the final velocity will effectively be a weighted average of the old velocity and the new one. When
# this velocity is the integrated into a new pose, the result can be sluggish covergence. This effect is especially
# noticeable with LIDAR data during rotations. To get around it, users can try inflating the process_noise_covariance
# for the velocity variable in question, or decrease the  variance of the variable in question in the measurement
# itself. In addition, users can also take advantage of the control command being issued to the robot at the time we
# make the prediction. If control is used, it will get converted into an acceleration term, which will be used during
# predicition. Note that if an acceleration measurement for the variable in question is available from one of the
# inputs, the control term will be ignored.
# Whether or not we use the control input during predicition. Defaults to false.

# [ADVANCED] The process noise covariance matrix can be difficult to tune, and can vary for each application, so it is
# exposed as a configuration parameter. This matrix represents the noise we add to the total error after each
# prediction step. The better the omnidirectional motion model matches your system, the smaller these values can be.
# However, if users find that a given variable is slow to converge, one approach is to increase the
# process_noise_covariance diagonal value for the variable in question, which will cause the filter's predicted error
# to be larger, which will cause the filter to trust the incoming measurement more during correction. The values are
# ordered as x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Defaults to the matrix below if
# unspecified.
